Intro to JS
- JS (Behavioral)
- CSS (Presentational)
- HTML (Structural)
- It's like building a house
  - CSS - fixtures, carpeting, paint
  - JS - electrical, plumbing, HVAC
  - HTML - framing, flooring, drywall
  - Server - foundation

Basic Variables
Variables - the nouns of programming, they are "things" (numbers, strings, booleans (true/false), etc.), composed of variable names and values
!- before a variable makes the variable return the opposite

Concatination - adding strings together

Console.log is a quick expression used to print content to the debugger.
  - it is very useful to troubleshoot
  - much easier way to see that your form is doing what you are expecting it to do.

Alert- ok prompt
Confirm- ok or cancel prompt
Prompt- ask for some sort of information to be entered, will always be returned as a string

Document.Write

If-Then Statements
- Super critical
- Each statement is composed of an if, else-if, or else (keyword), a condition, and the resulting code in {}.

== checks for the value, allows for coersion
=== checks for the type, has to match exactly to return true

Arrays
- Zebra(0), Rhino(1), Giraffe(2), Owl(3) - (indexes)
  - var zooAnimals = ["Zebra", "Rhino", "Giraffe", "Owl"]

What we will do today:
- Array Assignments
- Concept of For-Loops
  - Loops- I want you to do the same thing over again until I say stop. (repetitive tasks)
- The art of psuedo coding
  - if you can't explain the coding in words then you won't be able to do the actual coding
  - the exercise of saying what is my code going to do and write it out in words
- Building Rock Paper Scissors
  - last 30 minutes will be building this basic rock paper scissors app

What is JS?
- Every time you see something on a website that happens without refreshing the page is JS.
- Allows dev to create dynamic websites.
- declaring a variable
  - var
  - var name (var x) - there are certain words that it cannot be (basically any word that is used in JS to perform soemthing)
  - =
  - value
  - semicolon

What is meant by console.log?
- alert - var x = alert();
- prompt - prompt();
- confirm - confirm ();
- document.write -

What is an array?
- collection of variables
- can be string, numbers, booleans, etc.

For Loops
- for (var i = 0; i < vegetable.length; i++) { console.log("I love" + vegetable[i])};
  - iterator - first statement in the loop will only run one time
  - condition - second statement goes through the array until it's not true starting at 0
  - implimentation - third statement adds one to the last item of the array

Today we will cover
- JS Functions
- JS Objects
- Building simple JS Applications

Primitives
- booleans
- numbers
- strings

Arrays are a type of object not a primitive even though arrays can hold primitives.

Function
- something that performs a task. (simplest definition)
- when changing, updating or fixing things you only have to change it one time. The ability to maintain your code.
- allow you to standardize task so you don't have to rewrite code over and over again.
- always label for easy understanding of what it is doing
- decompose your code it to functions that have relatively small tasks and are easily readable.

Objects
- allow you to store any kind of data in a much simpler fashion
- syntax
  - var obj={};
  - ways to call object
    - me["name"]
    - me.name = x
- giant place to store data

You want to separate the data of an application out from the build and makeup of it

This
- Inside a function, the value of this depends on how the function is called.
- FUNCTION is a property of an object it's now a METHOD
  - Math.random is a method
  - This inside of a method refers to the object it is part of
- if THIS is in a function it refers to the global window object
- if THIS is in a method it refers to the object calling it

Today's class:
- DOM manipulation with JS
- DOM manipulation with jQuery
-

jQuery $(Begins)
- a helper library that is part of JS.
- a way to have a universal syntax of keeping track of things on the DOM.
-

Creating a new div from Console.
- to add newDiv to page you can use targetDiv.appendChild(newDiv)

only the word function creates another scope
function within a function is nested scope
